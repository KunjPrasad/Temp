**IMPORTANT: If trying to render a list in React:
(i) Make sure it has "key"
(ii) to convert from list-of-values to JSX, use .map() function, not .forEach()
-- forEach is suppose to do some action on each, but not collect the result of that action. Like, if you want to do [arr].forEach(console.log) to log each element
-- .map() collects the result of function application in an array. Thus, the array of elements get transformed to array of JSX which it then renders
